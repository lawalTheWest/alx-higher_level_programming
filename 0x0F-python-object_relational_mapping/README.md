# ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping.

It is a programming technique used to convert data between incompatible systems in object-oriented programming languages and relational databases
In simpler terms, it bridges the gap between the object-oriented world of application code and the relational world of databases.

## Why ORM systems are useful?

- **Abstraction:** ORM abstracts away the complexities of SQL queries and database schema details. Developers can work with high-level objects and methods, rather than dealing directly with database tables and SQL statements.

- **Productivity:** ORM tools often provide utilities and features to speed up development, such as automatic schema generation, query building interfaces, and caching mechanisms. This can reduce the amount of boilerplate code developers need to write.

- **Portability:** ORM frameworks are often designed to work with multiple database management systems (DBMS). This means that developers can write database-agnostic code, making it easier to switch between different database backends without significant code changes.

- **Maintainability:** By encapsulating database interactions within ORM models and classes, the code becomes more modular and easier to maintain. Changes to the database schema can often be accommodated with minimal impact on application code.

- **Object-Oriented Approach:** ORM allows developers to work with data in a way that is more aligned with the object-oriented paradigm, which is often the natural way of thinking for developers. This can lead to cleaner, more intuitive code.

The ORM systems can streamline database interactions, reduce development time, and improve code quality and maintainability. However, it is essential to understand the underlying principles of ORM and the performance implications of using such tools to make informed decisions when incorporating them into a project.
