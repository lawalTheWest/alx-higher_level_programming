# Python SQLAlchemy ORM with MySQL

---

## Introduction

This project showcases how to use SQLAlchemy, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool in Python, to interact with a MySQL database. SQLAlchemy simplifies database interactions by providing a Pythonic way to manage and query databases.

## Overview

The repository contains:

- **ORM Basics:** Introduction to SQLAlchemy, its benefits, and how it simplifies interactions with MySQL databases.
- **Requirements:** List of required libraries and tools needed to run the project.
- **Installation:** Step-by-step guide to set up and install the project dependencies.
- **Usage:** Detailed instructions on how to use SQLAlchemy to manage MySQL databases, perform CRUD operations, and handle relationships.
- **Examples:** Code snippets demonstrating various SQLAlchemy functionalities, querying methods, and relationship management.
- **Testing:** Guidelines for testing SQLAlchemy functionalities with MySQL databases, including sample test cases.
- **Contributing:** Information for contributors, guidelines, and how to get involved in the project.

## Usage

### Basic Usage Example:

```python
# Import SQLAlchemy Models and Session
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, MetaData
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

# Establish MySQL Connection
engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://user:password@localhost/database')
Base = declarative_base(bind=engine)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Define Model Classes
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    # Define columns, relationships, etc.

# Create Table
Base.metadata.create_all()

# Perform CRUD Operations, Querying, Relationships, etc.
# ...
```

### More Advanced Usage:

- **Querying:** Showcase querying methods such as `filter`, `order_by`, `limit`, etc. for MySQL databases.
- **Relationship Management:** Illustrate how to handle relationships between MySQL database tables using SQLAlchemy.
- **Transactions:** Demonstrate handling transactions in SQLAlchemy with MySQL.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Provide a set of unit tests for different SQLAlchemy functionalities with MySQL.
- **Integration Tests:** Examples of integration tests for SQLAlchemy with a sample MySQL database.
- **Testing Guide:** Instructions for running tests and adding new test cases.
