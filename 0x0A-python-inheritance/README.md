# 0x0A python inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental object-oriented programming concept (OOP) that allows you to create new classes based on existing ones. This concept promotes code reuse and organization.
To implement inheritance, a new class (the child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (the parent or superclass). This means that the child class can access and use the properties and behaviors of the parent class.

Inheritance enables the creation of more specialized classes that can extend or override the functionality of their parent classes, promoting a hierarchical structure in your code.

This powerful feature enhances code flexibility and simplifies maintenance in Python
